2. Move (google-homepage) repository to my local machine with 'clone [SSH key]'
3. cd into my new 'google-homepage' directory
4. Once in the 'google-homepage' directory, create a new READ.md file with touch
5. Begin adding these very lines of text (one-by-one) by using 'echo "text" >> READ.md'

16. Repaired nesting for 'waffle icon', 'sign in' and respective 'anchor links'
17. Added a magnifying glass to place inside search box
18. Set font (family, size and color) and text decoration (none) for all text, finished assigning classes and ids
19. Positioned top navigation, styled 'sign-in' button and declared 'strong {font-weight: bold;}'
20. Changed 'anchor hover' to 'underline' (apart from 'sign-in'), set 'sign-in cursor' to 'default', adjusted 'waffle icon' opacity in both static and hover states and adjusted hover opacity for top nav links: about, store, gmail and images
