Google Homepage From Scratch
1. Setup a new repository on Github (titled: google-homepage)
2. Move (google-homepage) repository to my local machine with 'clone [SSH key]'
3. cd into my new 'google-homepage' directory
4. Once in the 'google-homepage' directory, create a new READ.md file with touch
5. Begin adding these very lines of text (one-by-one) by using 'echo "text" >> READ.md'
6. Immediately found a better way to edit text in terminal, by way of vi (full-screen editor)
7.
