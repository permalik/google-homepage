Google Homepage From Scratch
1. Setup a new repository on Github (titled: google-homepage)
2. Move (google-homepage) repository to my local machine with 'clone [SSH key]'
3. cd into my new 'google-homepage' directory
4. Once in the 'google-homepage' directory, create a new READ.md file with touch
5. Begin adding these very lines of text (one-by-one) by using 'echo "text" >> READ.md'
6. Immediately found a better way to edit text in terminal, by way of vi (full-screen editor)
7. add README.md to staging
8. commit README.md to git with -m flag and subsequent "message"
9. Send README.md to github with git push origin main
10. Modifying this file with vi, then following steps 7-8 to show a modified file commit
